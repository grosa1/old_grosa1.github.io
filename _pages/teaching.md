        CS 188 is an upper-division introduction to artificial intelligence taught by <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~anca/" target="_blank">Prof. Anca Dragan</a>. Throughout the course, I covered concepts ranging from search algorithms, game trees, Markov decision processes, reinforcement learning, probabilistic graphical modeling, and machine learning. I held regular office hours, designed homework and exams, and led weekly one-hour discussion sections.
